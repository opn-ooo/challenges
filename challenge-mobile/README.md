# TAMBOON-MOBILE

`TamBoon`(n): Thai word for making merit. 

The assignment consists of two parts:
1. A server-side API: this has already been implemented for you
2. An iOS or Android application: please implement this part

### SERVER-SIDE API

Two example implementations are availble for you to use:

* A [Go](https://golang.org/) implementation (with a pre-compiled OS X binary) is provided
  inside the `tamboon-server` folder with a `Makefile` for building and running it.
* A [Swagger API automatic server](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/chakritw/tamboon-api/1.0.0)

You will need to obtain an Omise API key in order to start the Go implementation.

```sh
$ cd tamboon-server
$ export OMISE_SKEY=skey_your_omise_key
$ make run
```

The server should have 2 endpoints:

1. `GET /charities` - This endpoint should return a JSON list of charities similar to the
   following:

   ```json
   [
     { "id": 0, "name": "Ban Khru Noi", "logo_url": "http://rkdretailiq.com/news/img-corporate-baankrunoi.jpg" },
     { "id": 1, "name": "Habitat for Humanity Thailand", "logo_url": "http://www.adamandlianne.com/uploads/2/2/1/6/2216267/3231127.gif" },
     { "id": 2, "name": "Paper Ranger", "logo_url": "https://myfreezer.files.wordpress.com/2007/06/paperranger.jpg" },
     { "id": 3, "name": "Makhampom", "logo_url": "http://www.makhampom.net/makhampom/ppcms/uploads/UserFiles/Image/Thai/T14Publice/2554/January/Newyear/logoweb.jpg" }
   ]
   ```

2. `POST /donations` - This endpoint should accepts a JSON payload similar to the following:

   ```json
   {
     "name":   "John Smith",
     "token":  "tokn_test_123",
     "amount": 10000
   }
   ```
  The server should then creates a charge using the supplied token against the Omise API.


### MOBILE APPLICATION

The application should use the default platform style and should consists of two screens:

1. Charity list screen. - Load list of charities from the `/charities` server-side
   endpoint and display them using `RecyclerView` (Android) or `UITableView` (iOS). Tapping a
   charity should bring up the next screen.

2. Charity donation screen. - Shows a credit card number entry form and a field to enter
   donation amount in THB. Submitting the form should displays a progress spinner and send
   data to the `/donations` endpoint in the background. After everything is complete,
   bring up the next screen.

3. Success screen. - Shows a simple dismiss button that goes back to the first screen.

**DOs**

* Git version-control is being used with relevant commit messages.
* Code/architecture supports scaling and reusability
* Handles HTTP status codes properly.
* Handles API error response gracefully.
* Write clean, readable and well-structured code.
* Follow good platform development guidelines where applicable.
* Follow good UI/UX principles.
* Unit tests
* (Optional) Use one of the Omise-provided Mobile SDKs.
* (Bonus) Follow good security principles.
* (Bonus) UI Tests.

**DONTs**

Since this is just a quick test, you do not need to spend time on:

* Database, persistent storage or any form of caching.

**CAUTIONs**
Your assignment could be rejected if
* The project does not compile or run.
* There is little to none unit tests for the main business logic.
* Unreasonable amount of external libraries being used.
* Code are inconsistent, anti-patterns, or shown to be a direct duplication from other sources.
